# Hand-Sign


# Sign Language Recognition Model

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) fingerspelling using the Sign MNIST dataset. The model is trained to classify 26 hand gestures corresponding to the letters A-Z.

## Introduction

The goal of this project is to develop an accurate and efficient model to interpret sign language gestures from images. This application can help bridge communication gaps for the hearing impaired and foster better understanding in diverse environments.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this model consists of two CSV files:

- **sign_mnist_train.csv**: Contains training images and their corresponding labels.
- **sign_mnist_test.csv**: Contains validation images and their labels.

Each image is a 28x28 pixel grayscale image representing a sign language gesture.

### Sample Data Visualization

Below is a visualization of 10 random training images along with their corresponding labels:

![Sample Images](images/sample_images.png) <!-- Replace with an actual path to your generated image -->

## Model Architecture

The model is a simple CNN consisting of the following layers:

1. **Convolutional Layer**: 32 filters of size 3x3, followed by a ReLU activation function.
2. **Max Pooling Layer**: Reduces the spatial dimensions.
3. **Convolutional Layer**: 32 filters of size 3x3, followed by a ReLU activation function.
4. **Max Pooling Layer**: Further reduces the spatial dimensions.
5. **Flatten Layer**: Converts the 2D matrix into a 1D vector.
6. **Dense Layer**: 512 units with ReLU activation.
7. **Output Layer**: 26 units (one for each letter) with softmax activation for classification.

### Model Summary

```python
model.summary()  # This will display the model architecture
```

## Training Process

The model is trained using the following parameters:

- **Optimizer**: Adamax
- **Loss Function**: Sparse Categorical Crossentropy
- **Metrics**: Accuracy
- **Epochs**: 15

### Training History Visualization

During training, we track accuracy and loss for both training and validation sets. Below are the plots showing the performance over epochs:

## Results

After training, the model achieved the following results:
- **Final Training Accuracy**: XX%
- **Final Validation Accuracy**: XX%
